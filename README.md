# Marko Koen — Senior Software Architect / Systems Builder / Product engineer

I turn chaos into calm.

I operate as a senior technical leader, designing and building modern systems that scale — technically and organisationally. My focus is system architecture, distributed backend platforms, and building products the way the world is moving now: AI-first, automation-heavy, and outcome-driven.

I don’t just write code — I design systems, stabilise teams, and turn complex problems into simple, production-ready solutions.

---

## What I Do

- Architect large-scale distributed systems  
- Lead engineering teams through growth and uncertainty  
- Design clean, maintainable backend platforms  
- Build SaaS products from zero → production  
- Implement modern DevOps and deployment strategies  
- Apply AI pragmatically to real-world products  

I specialise in turning fragile or chaotic environments into calm, predictable, high-performing engineering organisations.

## Philosophy

- Simplicity beats cleverness  
- Shipping beats perfection  
- Architecture exists to serve people, not the other way around  
- Build for where the world is going — not where it was  

I care deeply about:
- System clarity  
- Ownership  
- Long-term maintainability  
- Developer experience  
- Real business outcomes

## Experience Highlights

Architected and led distributed backend platforms across high-scale commerce systems, built and grown engineering teams through acquisitions and restructuring, and delivered cloud-native solutions using Go, AWS/GCP, and modern DevOps practices under real production pressure.
